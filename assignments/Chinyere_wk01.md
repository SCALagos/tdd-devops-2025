Chinyere week 1 assignment.

Steps taken

I created a user account with home directory and login access.

I made a folder with 2 files, each with a different custom permission.

file 1 has rwx permission while

file 2 has only w permission

I completed the assignment with root user account because my non-root account had no permission to change ownership
