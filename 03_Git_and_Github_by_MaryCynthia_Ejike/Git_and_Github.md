## GIT AND GITHUB 

### ðŸ§  Objectives
- Understand version control systems
- Learn Git basics: commits, branches, merges
- Fork and clone a website project
- Make edits, push changes, and create a pull request
- Collaborate using GitHub (e.g., for SCAL team)

####  What Is Git?
- Git is a free and open-source distributed version control system (DVCS) used to track changes in source code during software development.

- It helps multiple developers collaborate on the same codebase without overwriting each otherâ€™s work â€” by saving versions, managing branches, and merging changes.

ðŸš€ Key Features of Git
Version Control	Records the history of every change to your code.
Distributed	Every developer has a full copy of the projectâ€™s history.
Branching	Allows working on new features without affecting the main code.
Merging	Combines changes from different branches.
Speed	Fast performance for commits, diffs, and merges.
### VERSION CONTROL
-  What is Version Control?
  
Version control is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so you can recall specific versions later.

#### Benefits
- Tracks history of changes
- Enables collaboration
- Supports experimentation via branches
- Facilitates issue resolution and rollback


#### Git Essentials
```bash

# Initialize Git in a Project
git init
# Staging and Committing

git add .                 # Stage all changes
git commit -m "message"   # Commit changes
# View Changes and History
git status
git log

```

#### Branching and Merging
Create and Switch to a Branch
```
git checkout -b new-feature
# Merge Branch into Main

git checkout main
git merge new-feature

```
####  Forking and Cloning a Sample Website

Step 1: Fork the Repository

Go to the GitHub repo (e.g., https://github.com/scal-org/sample-website) and click Fork.
This creates your own copy of the repo under your GitHub account.

Step 2: Clone Your Fork Locally
git clone https://github.com/your-username/sample-website.git
cd sample-website

#### Editing and Committing Changes
Make Edits
Open files in a code editor (e.g., index.html, style.css) and save changes.
Stage and Commit
```
git add .
git commit -m "Updated homepage content"
```
- Push Changes to Your Branch
If you created a branch:
```
git push origin your-branch-name
If working on main:
git push origin main
```
#### Create a Pull Request (PR)
- Go to your forked repo on GitHub
- Click Compare & pull request
- Ensure the base repo is scal-org/sample-website
- Add a descriptive title and summary

- Click Create pull request

âœ… This submits your changes to the repository for review and merging.

 #### GitHub Collaboration Tips
Always pull the latest changes before pushing:

```
git pull origin main
Use branches for new features or fixes:
git checkout -b fix-navbar
```
Use .gitignore to exclude unnecessary files (e.g., .env, node_modules/)

ðŸ§ª Example Workflow Summary (for SCAL)
#### Fork & Clone
```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/sample-website.git
cd sample-website
```
#### Create a branch
git checkout -b update-footer

#### Edit code (e.g., update footer in index.html)

#### Commit and push
```
git add .
git commit -m "Updated footer for SCAL site"
git push origin update-footer
```
Go to GitHub and create a pull request
